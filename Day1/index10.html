        <b>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</b><br>
         <mark>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making</mark><br> it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
         <em> a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,</em><br>
           <del>consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,</del><br>
            <u>discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum </u><br>
            et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
             very popular during the Renaissance.
         The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
